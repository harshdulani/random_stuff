3d Physics theory

Rigidbodies 
enable your GameObjects
to act under the control of physics. The Rigidbody can receive forces and torque to make your objects move in a realistic way. Any GameObject must contain a Rigidbody to be influenced by gravity, act under added forces via scripting, or interact with other objects through the NVIDIA PhysX physics engine.

Collider
these components define the shape of an object for the purposes of physical collisions. A collider, which is invisible, need not be the exact same shape as the object’s mesh and in fact, a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay.
>box, sphere, capsule and mesh
>box 2d, circle 2d, polygon

add multiple to an obj to create compound colliders
mesh more processor intensive than compound/simple

Convex mesh
>a mesh collider will normally be unable to collide with another mesh collider (ie, nothing will happen when they make contact).
>make convex. This will generate the collider shape as a “convex hull” which is like the original mesh but with any undercuts filled in.
