instantiate

Instantiate(PrefabToClone, PositionObject, RotationToUse);

eg:
public class UsingInstantiate : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Rigidbody rocketPrefab;
    //drag the prefab you wanna use onto this variable
    public Transform barrelEnd;			
    //create empty GameObject "RocketPlace" and place it at desired location. drag that GmeObject onto script variable to use it in barrelEnd var.
    
    
    void Update ()
    {
        if(Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1"))
        {
            Rigidbody rocketInstance;
            rocketInstance = Instantiate(rocketPrefab, barrelEnd.position, barrelEnd.rotation) as Rigidbody;
            //Instantiate returns an object data type, convert into a Rigidbody using "as"
            rocketInstance.AddForce(barrelEnd.forward * 5000);
            //some force to fire rocket
        }
    }
}

should destroy as hogs memory if not. eg:
public class RocketDestruction : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Destroy (gameObject, 1.5f);
        //destroy 1.5 secs after
    }
}

add both these files to prefab to have a ready for execution and deletion prefab
