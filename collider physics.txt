collider physics

messages

OnCollisionEnter	called when this collider/rigidbody has begun touching another rigidbody/collider.
OnCollisionExit		called when this collider/rigidbody has stopped touching another rigidbody/collider.
OnCollisionStay		called once per frame for every collider/rigidbody that is touching rigidbody/collider.
OnTriggerEnter		called when the Collider other enters the trigger.
OnTriggerExit		called when the Collider other has stopped touching the trigger.
OnTriggerStay		called almost all the frames for every Collider other that is touching the trigger. The function is on the physics timer so it won't necessarily run every frame.

Or
